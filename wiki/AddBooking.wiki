Room/Bed: Select an individual bed (for 1 guest), or select a room/group to auto-allocate the number of guest among the available beds.

Requested Room Type: Select from Mixed, Male or Female rooms. Rooms that have defined room types will be assigned first followed by rooms without specific gender assignments (see Resources). 

Assign To: Only assign to rooms with the selected properties ticked (see Resource Properties).

Clicking "Add" will allocate the guest(s) to the selected group/room(s) displayed in a table placed below under the status of "Reserved". Clicking on the date cell in the table will toggle the state from Reserved to Paid/Checked-in, Free, etc.. 

"Save" will permanently commit these changes.
