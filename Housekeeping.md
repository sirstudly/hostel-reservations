Groups/rooms are shown in the same order as in the [Resources](Resources.md) page. Empty beds are marked as E (should already have clean linen). / marks beds which have been slept in but don't require a change because the guest hasn't checked out yet. C indicates the guest should have checked out that day and require a new set of linen.

A rule may be updated in the Settings tab which indicate the maximum number of days that a bed can remain as / (unchanged). (e.g. force a change of sheets even if the same guest is in the bed every X number of days)

No changes can be made on this screen.
